## Train
1. Dowload Dataset JHU++ or UCF-QNRF.
2. Preprocess them by 'preprocess_dataset.py' or 'preprocess_dataset_ucf.py'.
3. Change the path to where your data and models are located in 'Train.py'.
4. Run 'Train.py'
5. Wait patiently for the program to finish.
6. Then you will get a good counting model!


## Test
1. Dowload Dataset JHU++ or UCF-QNRF.
2. Preprocess them by 'preprocess_dataset.py' or 'preprocess_dataset_ucf.py'.
3. JHU Model [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14piGsWRFy9BSXI1Jv9zRxypDxpOHbwCY/view?usp=sharing); UCF Model [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2WU0kIlZq3x28JZskvGx1cuZt0KQkXF/view?usp=sharing)
4. Change the path to where your data and models are located in 'Test.py'.
5. Run 'Test.py'.
